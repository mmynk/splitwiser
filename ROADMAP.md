# Splitwiser Roadmap

## Priority 1: Groups
Reusable participant groups for common splitting scenarios.

**Use cases:**
- Roommates splitting rent/utilities monthly
- Work lunch crew
- Travel groups
- Regular friend groups

**Features:**
- Create/edit/delete groups with named participants
- Select group when creating a bill to auto-populate participants
- Group management UI

## Priority 2: Settlements
Calculate optimal payments to settle balances.

**Features:**
- Track who paid vs who owes across bills
- Debt simplification algorithm (minimize number of transactions)
- "Settle up" suggestions (e.g., "Alice pays Bob $15")
- Mark debts as settled

## Future Ideas

### Receipt OCR
- Upload receipt image
- Auto-extract items and amounts
- Review/edit before saving

### Other Ideas
- Bill templates (save common bill structures)
- Notifications/reminders
- Export to CSV/PDF
- Multiple currencies
- Recurring bills
